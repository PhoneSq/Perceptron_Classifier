Subject: Weekly Team Meeting - Project Update

Hi everyone,

I hope you're all having a good week. I wanted to send out the agenda for our weekly team meeting scheduled for tomorrow at 2 PM.

We'll be discussing the following topics:
- Progress on the current development sprint
- Code review feedback from last week
- Planning for next quarter's milestones
- New team member onboarding process

Please come prepared with your status updates and any questions you might have about the upcoming deadlines.

Also, a reminder that we have the quarterly company presentation next month. I'll be reaching out to each team member individually to discuss your contributions.

If you can't make tomorrow's meeting, please let me know in advance so we can schedule a brief one-on-one to catch up.

Best regards,
Sarah Johnson
Development Team Lead
